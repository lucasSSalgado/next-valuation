                                and able” and the other group those that are “fortunate because they are able.” A high order 
                                of management ability is a must for both groups. No company grows for a long period of years just

                                research and development engineering begin to enter the picture. It is
                                largely through these means that companies improve old products and
                                develop new ones. This is the usual route by which a management not
                                content with one isolated spurt of growth sees that growth occurs in a
                                series of more or less continuous spurts.&quot;

                            <p className="italics">&quot;For a large number of publicly-owned companies it is not too difficult
                            to get a figure showing the number of dollars being spent each year on
                            research and development. Since virtually all such companies report
                            their annual sales total, it is only a matter of the simplest mathematics to
                            divide the research figure by total sales and so learn the per cent of each
                            sales dollar that a company is devoting to this type of activity.&quot;</p>
                            <p className="italics">&quot;Until the average investor tries it, he probably
                            will not believe how complete a picture will emerge if he asks
                            intelligent questions about a company’s research activities of a diversified
                            group of research people, some from within the company and others
                            engaged in related lines in competitive industries, in universities, and
                            in government. A simpler and often worthwhile method is to make a
                            close study of how much in dollar sales or net profits has been contributed
                            to a company by the results of its research organization during
                            a particular span, such as the prior ten years.&quot;</p>

                            <p className="italics">&quot;In this competitive age, the products or services of few companies are
                            so outstanding that they will sell to their maximum potentialities if they
                            are not expertly merchandised. It is the making of a sale that is the most
                            basic single activity of any business.Without sales, survival is impossible.&quot;</p>

                            The first step in examining profits is to study a company’s profit
                            margin, that is, to determine the number of cents of each dollar of sales
                            that is brought down to operating profit.&quot;</p>
