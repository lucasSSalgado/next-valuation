        "p1": "If someone tells you that they know how to properly value cryptocurrency assets, they are lying. If someone else tells you that assets without cash flows have no value, they are lying too. It’s pretty obvious that some Germans in the Weimar Republic would have had a good reason to invest in crypto, or my neighbors in Venezuela. The less property rights matter in a society, the more virtual scarcity matters for your well-being. In this scenario, I would prefer an unconfiscable asset over the best cash flow in the world.",
        "p2": "Some people argue that crypto is good for failed states and criminals, but think about what it means to be a criminal now, what it meant to be a criminal in the 1700s, or what it meant to be a criminal for the Soviets. The power to make monetary transactions without government permission is a legitimate demand.             Government control of currency, as practiced today, never existed before.",
        "p3": "Anyway, if you think crypto can be of some utility, it has value. Here are some materials that can help you properly try to value them.",
        "link1": "Offer a set of tools and models, everthing open source, to value bitcoin. Some of them are: Bitcoins Schrödinger Model, The Nakamoto Gauntlet and many others. ",
        "link2": "News, articles, podcasts and many other resources available in this site. Listen to one of the most evangeliser of bicoin today, Michael Saylor."
