PE ratios also suffer from other flaws, they disconsider the capinal employed to generate this earnings.",
                "q1": "We prefer instead to rely upon free cash flow yields when evaluating our investments, as not all Es – or Earnings – are created equal. Our portfolio companies’ businesses are less capital intensive than the market as whole. As their earnings are generated with less capital, their return on capital employed is much higher than the average, which we regard as the primary test of their performance. The return on capital of the companies in our portfolio averages 34%. This compares with an average of about 19% for the non-financial stocks in both the S&P 500 and the FTSE 100.",
                "p3": "Even though valuation matter, and Sir Smith sells and buys considering it, it is only a secondary indicator, low valuations and share price are not the most important information, the fundamental performance is. Looks like he is a big fan of Charlie Munger, the right hand man of Warren Buffet and will always refer to this quote when have the chance.",
                "q2": "‘Over the long term, it’s hard for a stock to earn a much better return than the business which underlies it earns. If the business earns 6% on capital over 40 years and you hold it for that 40 years, you’re not going to make much different than a 6% return – even if you originally buy it at a huge discount. Conversely, if a business earns 18% on capital over 20 or 30 years, even if you pay an expensive looking price, you’ll end up with a fine result.’ (Emphasis added.) I have no idea why Mr Munger chose those particular rates of return but what I do know is that he is not voicing an opinion. What he is describing is a mathematical certainty. If you invest for the long term in companies which can deliver high returns on capital, and which invest at least a significant portion of the cash flows they generate to earn similarly high returns, over time that has far more impact on the performance of the shares than the price you pay for them."

We seek to emulate Alex Bird – we wait until we know who has won and then wait for the bookmakers to offer us odds against them winning.",
                "p1": "A interesting part of Fundsmith strategy is to invest in companies that we all know are good, we are know are the winners in the field they act and wait to mr. market bet agaist then. He argue that is really hard to discover how will win in the market, is easy and profit to bet on the ones that already won. Some of this companies are: Colgate, Facebook, Microsoft, Nestle, etc. There are times when even this titanic business can be bottled at a reasonable price.",
                "q3": "There are some companies where we do not need to speculate on whether they have won in the sense of being successful and dominating certain product categories. Nestlé is the world’s largest food and beverage company and has been in business for 148 years with only one loss. Colgate Palmolive has 45% of the world market for toothpaste and 35% for toothbrushes. It is also the leader in liquid soap and third in pet food. We simply need to wait until the market misprices these shares in order to get our chance to bet on a certain winner. This can happen for many reasons, for example when a panic occurs such as the whole market experienced in 2008–09.",
                "q4": "Or currency moves such as the recent rise in the Swiss franc, which sent Nestlé’s shares down by more than 10% even though 98% of its business is outside Switzerland. Situations such as these can all provide chances to invest by betting on a certain winner if they drive the valuation to a level which does not reflect these companies’ sustainable returns.",
                "q5": "Yet Facebook is on an historic PE of 19.7× – about the same as the S&P 500. Unless there is going to be a much more severe deterioration in Facebook’s operational performance than we have seen to date or reasonably expect, this looks cheap to us.",
                "q6": "I strongly suspect that most people’s judgement of Facebook is based upon their personal experience and prejudices. But 69% of Facebook’s DAU and 73% of its MAU are outside the United States and Europe. How much do you think they care about allegations of misuse of data in a US election?",
                "q7": "One of the lessons this illustrates is that you may only get to invest in really good businesses at a cheap rating when they have a problem. Our Microsoft investment coincided with the troubled period under its previous CEO when it managed to come third in a two-horse race in mobile devices and second in a one-horse race in online search. Our job is to determine whether such problems are a temporary glitch that presents an opportunity for us as investors or an existential threat."

Mr Buffett correctly concluded that if the rate of return he could obtain by reinvesting funds at Berkshire was higher than the rate of return on the S&P 500 Index, it would produce a better performance for investors if he retained all the earnings and reinvested them. You might think you could get the same result if Berkshire paid a dividend and you reinvested it. Not if you pay income tax on your investment income, as you would only have the amount of the dividend net of tax to reinvest. So it is not the dividend that is important, or even just the reinvestment of the dividend, but rather it is the rate of return on reinvestment of the dividend that drives the return",
