            "p1": "Liquidation value refers to the estimated amount that would be received if all of a company's assets were sold off and its liabilities paid. This valuation method is crucial in scenarios such as bankruptcy, mergers and acquisitions, and distressed asset sales.",
            "p2": "Liquidation value provides an accurate estimate of what stakeholders might receive if a company is liquidated,  making it particularly useful in bankruptcy proceedings and for creditors determining their potential recovery. However, it often undervalues a company that could be worth more if it continues operations. Market conditions can significantly affect liquidation values, especially during economic downturns. Additionally, liquidation value typically results in a lower valuation compared to methods like book value or market value.",
            "p3": "To use a proper discount, consider factors like the age of the hard assets, alternative uses of the assets (specific machinery can be hard to sell), and desirability. For example, a car fleet or real estate is easier to sell and has a lesser discount compared to very specific machinery."
